## Project Overview

For this project, we were tasked with creating a neighborhood map using public API's. I decided to focus mine on the my favorite coffee offerings Reno has, and added a touch of local flair by utilizing the [UNR](https://www.unr.edu/) colors. In addition, the page features random background images from Unsplash.

This project utilizes:

- Google Maps API
- Foursquare API
- Unsplash Source
- Javascript
