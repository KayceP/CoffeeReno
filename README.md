## Project Overview

For this project, we were tasked with creating a neighborhood map using public API's. I decided to focus mine on the many wonderful coffee offerings Reno has, and added a touch of local flair by utilizing the [UNR](https://www.unr.edu/) colors. In addition, the page features random background images from Unsplash, as well as inspirational quotes (which go great with coffee of course!), served from the Forismatic API.

This project utilizes:

- Google Maps API
- Forismatic API
- Unsplash Source
- Javascript
- KnockoutJS
- HTML 5
- CSS3
